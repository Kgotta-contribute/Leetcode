<!-- Sure! Let's break down the regular expression used to validate the VTU USN:

```javascript
const usnPattern = /^[1-8][A-Z]{2}\d{2}[A-Z]{2}\d{3}$/;
```

Now, let's go through each part of the regular expression:

1. `^` - The caret symbol at the beginning of the pattern indicates that the match should start at the beginning of the input string.

2. `[1-8]` - This part ensures that the first character of the USN is a digit from 1 to 8. VTU assigns unique codes to 
colleges based on the first digit of the USN.

3. `[A-Z]{2}` - This part specifies that the next two characters should be uppercase letters (A to Z). In VTU USN, these 
two characters represent the branch code.

4. `\d{2}` - `\d` is a shorthand character class that matches any digit from 0 to 9. The `{2}` quantifier indicates that the 
previous pattern (in this case, `\d`) should occur exactly 2 times. This part represents the batch year, which consists of two digits.

5. `[A-Z]{2}` - Similar to step 3, this part specifies that the next two characters should be uppercase letters (A to Z). In 
VTU USN, these two characters represent the branch code again.

6. `\d{3}` - This part indicates that the last three characters should be digits. These three digits form the unique identifier 
within the branch.

7. `$` - The dollar sign at the end of the pattern indicates that the match should end at the end of the input string.

So, putting it all together, the regular expression validates that a VTU USN consists of the following structure:
- A digit from 1 to 8 at the beginning.
- Two uppercase letters representing the branch code.
- Two digits representing the batch year.
- Two uppercase letters representing the branch code again.
- Three digits representing the unique identifier.

Example valid VTU USNs according to this pattern would be: 1CR17CS001, 2ME20IS123, 3EC19EC010, etc.

It's essential to note that this regular expression only checks the format of the USN and doesn't guarantee that the USN is 
assigned to a real student or exists in the VTU database. For real-world applications, you may need to combine this format 
check with additional checks or database verification for authenticity. -->
